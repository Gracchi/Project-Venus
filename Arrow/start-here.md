How many times you wanted to run a quick nmap test to find out that it has been blacklisted.

**Venus-Arrow** is a simple python script that performs basic nmap tasks.

It is extremly simple to use, a light weight tool that will go undetected in most environments.

And very handy during any **Penetration Testing**, if nmap is blocked on the network you are working with.

It will work against any IP address or domain name url, just specify the ports separated by commas ... and give it few seconds.
