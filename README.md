# Project Venus

In the realm of cybersecurity, the roles of penetration testers and defenders are crucial in ensuring the resilience of computer systems and protecting against ever-evolving threats.
As cyber threats continue to evolve and grow in sophistication, the need for robust and effective security measures is more critical than ever.
Project Venus is an arsenal of python scripts, designed to empower penetration testers and defenders in their efforts to identify vulnerabilities, conduct thorough assessments, and fortify the defences of digital infrastructures. Those scripts have been coded, gathered, enhanced, and tested in live environments. 
I kept the code simple, clean as much as possible.
