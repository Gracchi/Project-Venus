# Project Venus

In the realm of cybersecurity, the roles of penetration testers and defenders are crucial in ensuring the resilience of computer systems and protecting against ever-evolving threats.
As cyber threats continue to evolve and grow in sophistication, the need for robust and effective security measures is more critical than ever.
</br>
Project-Venus is an arsenal of python scripts, designed to empower penetration testers and defenders in their efforts to identify vulnerabilities, conduct thorough assessments, and fortify the defences of digital infrastructures. 
</br>
Those scripts have been coded, gathered, enhanced, and tested in live environments.
I kept the code simple, clean as much as possible.
</br>

This is a labour of love and work in progress, created by Chadi Saliby aka Gracchi a cybersecurity researcher. 
Project-Venus will include both blue and red team scripts.
